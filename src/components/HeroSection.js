              Hi, my name is <span className="emphasized">Elma</span>. I work as
              a frontend developer and web designer in Sweden. I'm driven to the
              stories people create through their interactions with different
              kinds of interfaces and technologies. I aim to design user
              interfaces that are reliable and accessible, built with a solid
              foundation in human-computer interaction.
